A decentralized authentication service to verify legitimate human users and enhance server security.
## Motivation & Features
Welcome to our innovative project, "Defndr". In an era where server security is of paramount importance, we present a solution that revolutionizes user authentication. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, our project seeks to provide a decentralized authentication service that can verify the legitimacy of human users. By distributing the authentication process, we aim to enhance server security while eliminating the risks associated with centralized systems. Our project empowers organizations to confidently differentiate between genuine human users and potential threats, thereby fortifying their defenses and safeguarding sensitive data. Join us on this journey towards a more secure and reliable digital landscape.
